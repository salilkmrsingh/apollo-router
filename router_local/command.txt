Run below command to start the router in dev mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can run apollo router integrated with graphos.

//setup the api key with apollo studio
rover config auth

//create a supergraph called 'my-supergraph' in graphos registery with version 'current'
rover graph create my-supergraph --variant current

//Publish subgraphs

rover subgraph publish my-supergraph@current \
  --name products \
  --schema ./products.graphql \
  --routing-url https://products.example.com/graphql

//Fetch the composed supergraph

rover supergraph fetch my-supergraph@current

//connect to apollo router by setting in router.yaml
supergraph:
  source:
    from:
      uplink:
        graphref: my-supergraph@current
        api_key: ${APOLLO_KEY}

//run the router
export APOLLO_KEY="service:<your-service-key>"
./router --config router.yaml
